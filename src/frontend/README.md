## Theming Using Mui-Theme-Creator

---

Material-UI is a popular React UI library that allows developers to create beautiful, responsive user interfaces. One of the key features of Material-UI is its theming system, which allows developers to easily customize the appearance of their applications using a theme object.


## Step 1: Create a Custom Theme with Mui-Theme-Creator

To create a custom Material-UI theme using mui-theme-creator:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/.

2. Use the sliders and color pickers to adjust the various properties of the theme, such as the primary color, secondary color, typography, and spacing. You can also adjust the "Advanced options" to further customize the theme.

3. As you make changes, the preview on the right side of the screen will update to show you how the theme will look in practice.

4. Once you are happy with your custom theme, click the "Export" button to download a JavaScript file containing the theme object.


## Step 2: Integrate the Custom Theme into Your Project

Now that we have a custom Material-UI theme, let's integrate it.

Copy the downloaded JavaScript file containing the theme object to your project directory. Replace Theme.tsx `src/frontend/src/Theme.tsx`

Thats it!
